            'I resigned from my previous position to focus on my health, having experienced chronic Office Syndrome on no fewer than two occasions. Shortly after my resignation, an unexpected incident occurred: I lifted a heavy object incorrectly, resulting in Piriformis Syndrome, or sciatic nerve impingement by the piriformis muscle, with radiating pain down my left leg. This condition rendered me unable to walk for several months, necessitating a prolonged period of recovery.',
            'I am now in a much improved condition. While I continue to undergo physical therapy, I can walk freely and have resumed my normal daily activities. During my rehabilitation, I also upskilled by working on various projects relevant to the Front-end Developer position I am currently seeking. My portfolio website showcases both my professional experience in this role and the projects I completed during my recovery, which I believe will be valuable for prospective employers.',
